Birth — 12 months

Parents of infants can help set the stage for healthy teeth and gums in the first year of a child’s life.

1. After Feedings, brush the kid’s mouth using a soft-bristled baby A soft washcloth.

2. Schedule Routine Dental check-ups along with your child’s pediatrician, that will assess your baby’s Mouth as a portion of this examination.

3. The American Dental Association recommends a first visit with the dentist by 12 months of age.

12 months — Age 2

Once a Child’s baby teeth have come (the very first tooth usually appears between four months and 12 weeks; and all baby teeth, such as molars, should come in before age three), proper brushing and dental hygiene becomes even more important.

Begin to Teach your child proper brushing habits by cleaning their teeth twice a day, morning and evening. Parents, you’ll have to do the cleanup at this age, but this routine will also help prepare your child to brush alone when ready.

Brush your Child’s teeth with a soft-bristled brush and non-fluoride toothpaste made for toddlers. Brush the bottoms and backs of teeth, as well as your child’s tongue. (Kids at this age are too young for fluoride toothpaste but they ought to acquire adequate fluoride from your community’s municipal water supply.)

Schedule a check-up with dentist dublin ohio. Good preventive care at this age can help prevent more serious dental issues later. This visit is also a good time to discuss your child’s bite, pacifier use and other mouth-related issues..

Age 2 and older

With your help and encouragement, your child’s dental care habits should be well established by age two. Keep up the good work!

By age two, you may begin using a fluoride toothpaste for your child, but be sure to use only a small amount. A pea-sized dollop on a soft brush should do the trick.

Also by this age, your child’s teeth are likely growing closer together. Once two teeth touch, it’s time to start flossing your child’s teeth daily.

Limit juice and offer more water to drink. Juice can be high in sugar, which can lead to tooth decay. It’s important to maintain healthy baby teeth while a child’s mouth prepares for the permanent teeth that will come in later.
